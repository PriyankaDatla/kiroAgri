# 🌾 KiroAgri – AI-Powered Rural Advisory & Sustainability Platform

KiroAgri is an AI-powered platform designed to support farmers and rural communities with intelligent, localized, and easy-to-understand agricultural guidance. The system leverages artificial intelligence to analyze natural language queries and contextual data to provide recommendations related to crop selection, irrigation planning, and sustainable farming practices.



## 🚀 Problem Statement
Rural farmers often lack timely access to reliable and localized agricultural guidance. Traditional advisory systems are mostly rule-based and struggle to adapt to regional variability, climate uncertainty, and unstructured user inputs.



## 💡 Solution Overview
KiroAgri uses AI models to understand farmer queries, retrieve relevant knowledge, and generate explainable recommendations that help improve productivity while promoting sustainable agriculture.



## 🧠 Key Features
- AI-powered crop recommendations  
- Smart irrigation advisory  
- Sustainable farming guidance

- Scalable and secure architecture  


## 🤖 Why AI?
KiroAgri relies on NLP and machine learning models to:
- Understand unstructured farmer queries  
- Learn from diverse agricultural data  
- Adapt recommendations based on context and uncertainty  

A purely rule-based approach cannot handle these complexities effectively.
